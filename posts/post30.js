    <h2>üáµüá∞ Pakistan: Young Guns Take Charge</h2>
    <p>
      With <strong>Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan rested</strong>, the spotlight shifted to <strong>Salman Ali Agha</strong>, who led a youthful but talented Pakistan side. The team was packed with explosive talent:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Mohammad Haris</strong>: In sublime form <strong>66 off 43</strong> after early wickets fell.</li>
      <li><strong>Fakhar Zaman</strong>: Steady hand <strong>23* off 16</strong>, guiding the late surge.</li>
      <li><strong>Saim Ayub</strong>: All-rounder threat valuable with both bat and ball.</li>
      <li><strong>Shaheen Afridi</strong>: Pace spearhead early breakthroughs key.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Despite losing openers <strong>Saim Ayub and Sahibzada Farhan for golden ducks</strong>, Pakistan recovered thanks to a crucial <strong>85-run stand between Haris and Fakhar</strong>. Hasan Nawaz added quickfire 19 off 10, helping them reach a competitive <strong>160/7</strong>.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Betting Insight</strong>: Back <em>Saim Ayub to take a wicket AND score 15+</em> excellent value due to his all-round role.</p>

    <h2>üá¥üá≤ Oman: Making History on the Big Stage</h2>
    <p>
      For <strong>Oman</strong>, this match was <strong>more than just a game</strong> it was a <strong>dream come true</strong>. As debutants in the Asia Cup, they entered as massive underdogs but showed grit and heart.
    </p>

    <p>
      Key performers:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Aamir Kaleem</strong>: Took <strong>3/28</strong> disciplined and clever.</li>
      <li><strong>Shah Faisal</strong>: Also claimed <strong>3 wickets</strong> proved Oman can compete.</li>
      <li><strong>Jatinder Singh (C)</strong>: Composed innings under pressure.</li>
      <li><strong>Mohammad Nadeem</strong>: Solid support in the middle order.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Though chasing <strong>161</strong> was tough, Oman fought hard. Their performance earned respect and highlighted the growth of associate cricket.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Betting Tip</strong>: Avoid ‚ÄúOman to Win‚Äù odds are tempting, but gap remains wide. Bet on <em>Oman Top Batter</em> or <em>Total Sixes Over 5.5</em> instead.</p>

    <p>
      No prior T20I meetings. Conditions in Dubai favor chasing teams due to dew.
    </p>

    </blockquote>

    <h2>Final Thoughts: Who Will Prevail?</h2>
    <p>
      Pakistan enters as <strong>strong favorites</strong>, and their decision to <strong>bat first</strong> played into the <strong>Dubai dew factor</strong>. If their bowlers can restrict Oman to under <strong>140</strong>, the chase will be clinical.
    </p>
