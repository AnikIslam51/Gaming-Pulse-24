      A low deposit (like 100 Tk) lets you test the waters, understand odds, try different games, 
      and build confidence without pressure. Itâ€™s also ideal for students, busy professionals, 
      and casual players who value <em>budget control</em> and <em>responsible play</em>.

      <li><strong>Game rotation:</strong> mix low-volatility slots with selective sports bets for balance.</li>
