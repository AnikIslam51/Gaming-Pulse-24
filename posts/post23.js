    <h2>Netherlands Innings: Spin Strangles the Dutch</h2>
    <p>
      Bangladesh’s decision to <strong>field first</strong> paid off instantly. <strong>Left-arm spinner Nasum Ahmed</strong> was the star with the ball, delivering a sensational spell of <strong>3 for 21</strong>. He removed <strong>Max O'Dowd early</strong> and then shattered the middle order by dismissing <strong>Teja Nidamanuru for a golden duck</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Despite a fighting 30 from <strong>Aryan Dutt</strong> and 24 from <strong>Vikramjit Singh</strong>, the Netherlands never gained momentum. Pacers <strong>Taskin Ahmed (2/22)</strong> and <strong>Mustafizur Rahman (2/18)</strong> provided tight support, wrapping up the innings in just 17.3 overs.
    </p>

    <h2>Bangladesh Batting: Clinical Chase Led by Tanzid Hasan</h2>
    <p>
      Chasing 104, Bangladesh started aggressively. <strong>Parvez Hossain Emon</strong> scored 23 before being dismissed in the sixth over. But <strong>Tanzid Hasan</strong> remained unshaken, anchoring the innings with an unbeaten <strong>54 off 40 balls</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Captain <strong>Litton Das</strong> joined him at the crease and remained <strong>18* off 18</strong>, as the duo completed the chase with an <strong>unbroken 64-run partnership</strong>. The win was sealed in just 13.1 overs — a testament to Bangladesh’s growing confidence.
