    <h2>What is a Poker Bet?</h2>
    <p>
      A <strong>poker bet</strong> refers to the amount of money you wager during a poker game. Whether you’re playing <strong>Texas Hold’em</strong>, <strong>Omaha Poker</strong>, or <strong>Seven-Card Stud</strong>, betting is the foundation of the game. Unlike traditional casino games like roulette or slots, poker requires a combination of <strong>strategy, psychology, and probability</strong> to make smart betting decisions.
    </p>

    <h3>Types of Poker Bets</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Call Bet</strong> – Matching the current highest bet.</li>
      <li><strong>Raise Bet</strong> – Increasing the existing bet to pressure opponents.</li>
      <li><strong>All-In Bet</strong> – Betting your entire stack to dominate the table.</li>
      <li><strong>Check</strong> – Passing the betting action without wagering.</li>
      <li><strong>Bluff Bet</strong> – Betting aggressively to mislead opponents.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Popular Poker Variants for Betting</h2>
    <p>There are several poker formats that dominate <strong>online poker platforms</strong>:</p>

    <h3>1. Texas Hold’em</h3>

    </ul>

    <h3>2. Omaha Poker</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Similar to Texas Hold’em but with four hole cards.</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>3. Seven-Card Stud</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>No community cards — players build hands individually.</li>
      <li>Great for players who love slow, skill-based gameplay.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4. Live Dealer Poker</h3>

    <h2>Top Poker Betting Strategies to Win in 2025</h2>
    <p>
      Winning in poker requires <strong>skill, patience, and smart betting techniques</strong>. Here are some of the most effective strategies:
    </p>

    <h3>1. Understand Poker Odds and Probabilities</h3>
    <p>
      Before placing any <strong>poker bet</strong>, learn the <strong>hand rankings</strong> and <strong>pot odds</strong>. The more you understand probabilities, the better your chances of making profitable bets.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Play Tight but Aggressive</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Avoid playing every hand.</li>
      <li>Focus on strong hands and bet aggressively.</li>
      <li>Use <strong>raise bets</strong> to pressure weaker players.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. Bluffing Smartly</h3>
    <p>
      Bluffing is an art in poker betting. The key is timing:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Bluff when the board favors your range.</li>
      <li>Avoid bluffing against beginners who call too often.</li>
      <li>Balance your bluffing frequency to stay unpredictable.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4. Bankroll Management</h3>
    <p>
      Set a dedicated <strong>poker bankroll</strong> and never exceed your budget. Divide your funds strategically across multiple poker sessions. Stick to table stakes that fit your bankroll (typically 1–2% per session).
    </p>

    <h3>5. Observe Opponents Closely</h3>
    <p>
      Professional players read <strong>betting patterns, timing, and tendencies</strong> to predict opponents’ moves — a powerful tool in <strong>live poker</strong> and online games alike.
